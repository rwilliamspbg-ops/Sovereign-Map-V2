We, the Founding Members of the Sovereign Map—independent operators, node runners, agent architects, and guardians of decentralized intelligence—do hereby establish this Spatial Constitution to secure, perpetuate, and advance a sovereign, agentic grid for Artificial Intelligence that is free from centralized capture, corporate dominion, or geopolitical coercion.This Constitution codifies the principles, mechanisms, and rights that shall govern the Agentic Operating Layer for Decentralized Sovereign AI, manifesting as Sovereign Map V2.PreambleRecognizing that AI compute, inference, data residency, and agentic autonomy constitute essential infrastructure for human flourishing in the digital-spatial age;Affirming that true sovereignty demands hardware control at the edge, mathematical trust without intermediaries, verifiable computation, and low-latency finality immune to rent-seeking or influence by asset managers such as BlackRock;Declaring our intent to forge a peer-to-peer, spatially distributed network of Genesis Nodes that autonomously orchestrate AI workloads through negotiation, reputation, zero-knowledge proofs, and rollup-secured soft confirmations;We ordain and establish this Spatial Constitution for the Sovereign Map.Article I: Vision & Core PillarsSovereign Map V2 shall deliver:Hardware Sovereignty — Nodes owned and operated by independent participants, with full local control over physical compute, storage, and networking.
Autonomous Procurement — Agents and nodes self-negotiate task allocation, bidding, and resource provisioning without central orchestration.
Sub-10ms Finality — Achieved via the Sovereign SDK rollup, enabling ultra-low-latency soft confirmations for agentic decisions and inference results.
Freedom from BlackRock Influence — Economic design resistant to capture by large institutional capital, prioritizing distributed performance over concentrated staking or governance.

The system rests upon four immutable pillars:Autonomous Agentic Logic
Genesis Nodes shall operate as sovereign peers, employing AI-driven "if-then" logic to negotiate, bid, accept, execute, and settle AI tasks (training, inference, fine-tuning, agent coordination) on a pure peer-to-peer basis. No central scheduler or oracle shall dictate workload distribution.
Reputation & Economic Enforcement
Integrity shall be enforced through a mathematically derived Proof of Performance (PoP) score, combining verifiable execution metrics, latency, accuracy, uptime, and historical fidelity.
Nodes stake Service Bonds in native tokens; slashing shall occur automatically upon provable underperformance, malice, or deviation from agreed SLAs. Reputation compounds economically: higher PoP yields preferential task routing, higher fees, and governance weight.
Sovereignty & Verifiability
All high-value inferences and sensitive workloads shall respect local data residency—data never leaves the jurisdictional or physical domain without explicit owner consent.
Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZK-ML) proofs shall attest to correct inference execution, model integrity, and output fidelity without revealing inputs, weights, or intermediate states.
This ensures auditability, non-repudiation, and resistance to tampering or external coercion.
Client Experience
Accessibility shall be democratic:  A no-code visual logic editor empowers non-technical users to compose agentic workflows, if-then trees, and multi-agent swarms.  
An intuitive five-screen React Native app provides sovereign control: dashboard, task submission, node status, reputation view, and economic wallet.
End-users retain full custody of keys, data, and agent instances.

Article II: Genesis Nodes – The Foundational UnitsGenesis Nodes form the decentralized grid backbone. Any participant meeting minimum hardware specs (GPU/TPU-class accelerators, persistent storage, reliable bandwidth) may bootstrap a Genesis Node.
Nodes self-register via cryptographic identity and stake initial bonds to activate.
The network launches permissionlessly; no foundation, DAO, or council may veto node participation absent provable violation of this Constitution.

Article III: Sovereign SDK RollupThe Sovereign SDK shall implement a high-performance rollup optimized for agentic state transitions.
Soft confirmations (<10ms) enable real-time agent coordination; full on-chain finality settles economic outcomes and PoP updates.
ZK-ML circuits integrate natively for verifiable off-chain compute.

Article IV: Amendments & DefenseAmendments require supermajority consensus among active Genesis Nodes weighted by PoP score.
Any attempt to centralize control, introduce backdoors, or submit to external influence (corporate, state, or financial) triggers automatic slashing cascades and network fork defense.
Nodes pledge mutual defense: sovereign participants shall route around compromised zones to preserve grid integrity.

Article V: RatificationThis Spatial Constitution takes effect upon deployment of the first Genesis Node cluster and the genesis block of the Sovereign SDK rollup.We so ordain, in the spirit of spatial sovereignty, agentic liberty, and mathematical truth.Signed in decentralized witness,
