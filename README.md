**SovereignMap** is the backbone of decentralized spatial awareness mapping and digital identity expansion. It is a next-generation protocol designed to facilitate digital sovereign mapping across all devices capable of spatial awareness, transforming raw environmental data into a self-sustaining intelligence mesh.

## 🌐 Vision

In an era of centralized surveillance, SovereignMap returns spatial intelligence to the edge. By utilizing decentralized mesh networking and Google Gemini's advanced reasoning, we've created a system where mapping is not just a utility, but a sovereign asset controlled by its operators.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Neural Atlas (Semantic Topography)
Powered by `gemini-3-flash-preview`, the Atlas transforms raw point-cloud data and GPS telemetry into human-readable semantic intelligence. It identifies mesh density bottlenecks and synthesizes topological reports for sovereign sectors.

### 2. Autonomous Governance Core
A self-sustaining economic layer that uses AI-driven Network Orchestration (ANO). The mesh automatically generates optimization proposals, adjusting staking rewards, slashing rates, and sync periods based on real-time network health.

### 3. Neural Voice Link (Live API)
A low-latency, real-time audio interface utilizing `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`. Operators can query the mesh hands-free during spatial scanning, receiving tactical updates directly from the Mesh Oracle.

### 4. Security Perimeter
Quantum-resistant encryption layers and Decentralized Identity (DID) handshakes ensure that every node in the mesh is verified. Features include:
- **RSA-Q 8k Layer** encryption.
- **Pattern Recognition Sentry** for sybil attack detection.
- **Master Key Rotation** via automated neural protocols.

### 5. Verification Hub
A comprehensive audit suite that validates spatial consistency, P2P latency, and consensus integrity. Results are synthesized into high-level intelligence reports for network transparency.

## 📦 Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- An active Google Cloud Project with Gemini API access.
- `process.env.API_KEY` configured in your environment.

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rwilliamspbg-ops/Sovereign-Map.git

# Navigate to directory
cd Sovereign-Map

# Install dependencies (using esm.sh imports)
# No build step required for modern esm-module browsers
```

### Deployment Rule
For production environments, ensure the `requestFramePermissions` for **Camera, Microphone, and Geolocation** are handled by the host container to enable full spatial scanning and Voice Link capabilities.
