**SovereignMap** is the backbone of decentralized spatial awareness mapping and digital identity expansion. It is a next-generation protocol designed to facilitate digital sovereign mapping across all devices capable of spatial awareness, transforming raw environmental data into a self-sustaining intelligence mesh.

## 🌐 Vision

In an era of centralized surveillance, SovereignMap returns spatial intelligence to the edge. By utilizing decentralized mesh networking and ( using Google Gemini's advanced reasoning) until Node Developement, we've created a system where mapping is not just a utility, but a sovereign asset controlled by its operators.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Neural Signal HUD (Real-Time Telemetry)
The Network Registry now features a **Neural Signal HUD** for every node. This includes:
- **Reactive Waveforms**: Real-time SVG/Canvas visualizations of node latency and spectral density.
- **Signal Jitter Analysis**: Precise monitoring of packet loss and temporal drift.
- **Dynamic Spectral Bars**: Flickering visual indicators of connection strength and neural link health.

### 2. Deep Threat Analysis (Gemini-Powered)
The Security Ops center is equipped with a **Deep Threat Scan** utility. Powered by `gemini-3-flash-preview`, it:
- Aggregates real-time network logs and firewall intercepts.
- Identifies coordinated attack patterns (Sybil, Eclipse, Routing manipulation).
- Generates tactical mitigation strategies and autonomous defense maneuvers.

### 3. Advanced Spatial Rendering
Our 3D engine has been upgraded for maximum immersion:
- **Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)**: Enhanced depth and realism using Screen Space Ambient Occlusion.
- **Volumetric Fog & Lighting**: Deep atmospheric immersion with dynamic point-light pulses synchronized with Lidar scans.
- **Crystalline Mesh Nodes**: High-fidelity Physical Materials for all network entities.

### 4. Neural Voice Link (Live API)
A low-latency, real-time audio interface utilizing `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`. Operators can query the mesh hands-free during spatial scanning, receiving tactical updates directly from the Mesh Oracle.

### 5. Autonomous Governance Core
A self-sustaining economic layer that uses AI-driven Network Orchestration (ANO). The mesh automatically generates optimization proposals, adjusting staking rewards, slashing rates, and sync periods based on real-time network health.
