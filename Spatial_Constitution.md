This document serves as the foundational "social and economic immune system" for the decentralized grid, codifying the principles of hardware sovereignty and autonomous agentic governance.

The Spatial Constitution of Sovereign Map

Preamble:

We, the independent operators of the Sovereign Map, establish this Constitution to secure a decentralized infrastructure for the Agentic Economy. We reject centralized cloud extraction and institutional oversight in favor of a self-governing grid where control over infrastructure, data, and compute remains strictly sovereign.

Article I:

Sovereignty of the Node (The Genesis Pillar)

Definition of a Node: A Genesis Node is an autonomous entity capable of self-governing resource procurement and execution without centralized oversight.   

Hardware Autonomy: Every node must maintain "Hardware Sovereignty," utilizing on-premise or localized GPU clusters to ensure data residency.   

The 2026 Industrial Standard: To participate in the sovereign tier, nodes must meet minimum specifications: 24GB+ VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090), 96GB+ DDR5 RAM, and 1Gbps symmetric fiber.

Article II:

The Rule of Mathematical Trust (Reputation & Security)

Proof of Performance (PoP): Trust is not granted; it is mathematically earned through a multi-dimensional score (0-1000) based on availability, integrity, and latency.   

Verifiable Inference: All AI outputs must be cryptographically verifiable via ZK-ML proofs (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning). Failure to provide a matching proof results in immediate "Hard Slashing".   

Adaptive Tiers: The network recognizes three tiers of participation:

Tier 1 (Sovereign): Reserved for the top 5% of nodes for critical and private data processing.   

Tier 2 (Standard): For general AI code monetization.   

Tier 3 (Experimental): A "warm-up" tier for new nodes to build initial reputation

Article III:

Economic Enforcement (The Service Bond)

The Reputation-Collateral Link: Node operators must maintain "skin in the game" by staking SOV tokens into a programmable Service Bond (SB) contract.   

The Slashing Protocol:

Soft Slashing: Minor deductions (0.01%–0.5%) for high latency or missed uptime.   

Hard Slashing: Significant deductions (10%–100%) for tampered output or integrity failures.   

Quarantine Mode: Any node whose reputation drops by more than 10% in 24 hours is automatically barred from procurement bids until audited.

Article IV:

The Agentic Marketplace (Autonomous Procurement)

"If-Then" Governance: Nodes shall interact via an autonomous "if-then" communication protocol, negotiating service-level agreements (SLAs) on-chain without human intervention.   

The 10ms Mandate: The Sovereign SDK must provide soft-confirmations in under 10ms to ensure real-time resource allocation and competitive bidding.   

Blind Bidding: To prevent front-running, all bids for AI tasks are handled via commit-reveal or encryption schemes within the Agentic Logic.

Article V:

Sustainable Growth & Treasury

The 80/15/5 Distribution:

80% Liquid Earnings: Returned to the operator for operational costs.   

15% Auto-Compounding: Re-invested into the node's Service Bond to increase its "Trust Capacity".   

5% Infrastructure Fee: Directed to the Independent Treasury for security audits and R&D.   

Institutional Independence: Capital and governance are strictly restricted to independent developers and sovereign offices. Zero involvement from major institutional asset managers is permitted.

Article VI:

Expansion and Scalability

The 1,000-Node Grid: By the end of 2026, the network shall scale to 1,000 nodes across 20+ global sub-regions to ensure data residency across legal jurisdictions.   

Edge AI Factories: Expansion will prioritize high-density "Edge AI factories" in industrial parks to minimize latency for real-time inference.
